# Responsive Portfolio
Homework for UT Coding Bootcamp week 2


GitHub Pages link: https://lilicecilia23.github.io/responsive-portfolio/

I built this responsive website using BootStrap. It has 3 pages:
    1. About Me (introduction)
    2. Contact (a form with which a user could potentially reach out to me)
    3. Portfolio (a space to display my current and future projects)
